DOSim is developed on DO to 1) measure the similarity between DO terms, 2) measure the similarity between human genes based on DO, 3) detect disease-related gene modules and explore their functional meaning from gene sets, 4) conduct DO enrichment analysis, and 5) visualize hierarchies in DO and extract related terms for the given DO terms. It focuses on the reflection of the modular characteristics of disease related genes and we believe it will promote our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of diseases
