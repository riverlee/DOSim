DOSim is developed for facilitating researchers to explore the disease risk feature of the gene sets. Currently, DOSim provides four functions: 1) measuring the similarity between DO terms, 2) measuring the similarity between human genes, 3) conducting DO enrichment analysis, and 4) visualizing hierarchies in DO and extracting related terms for the given DO terms.
